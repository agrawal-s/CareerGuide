Python Integrated database project to simulate Agile methodology


'''

Career Guide

The project Career Guide showcases an interactive Python Console based platform for Job search engine
with various user based functionalities like register, Login, job search and job application etc.
The project focusses on following aspects:

1. Learn to program using python
2. Learn to use Oracle database as a back-end database system
3. Integrate Oracle database with python to provide an interactive front-end back-end application.
4. use the application to test various use-cases and build a better model henceforth.

The project is divided into various sub-tasks which handle various functionalities.

The project uses agile methodology and provides a schematic timeline based approach to build various sub-sections of the whole application and then
test them individually in the Unit testing and sytem testing phase. Once all the sub-sections are built successfully, System Integration phase 
is launched where all the sub-sections are brought together under a single ubmrella and a 
front end module is developed to interact with all the functionalities. 

This approach helps us to optimise each unit and therefore, the whole project. This also ensures that the product is quality assured and not quality controlled.

'''

The project is divided into Four phases, later to be known as sprints:

Phase 1: Planning and Ground work:

This Phase focusses on the documentation, planning and timeline management of the project.
Phase will kick-off with the documentation of all the functionality required in the application, their business requirements and use cases.
This time will also be utilised for building a robust test plan in order to maintain quality assurance. 

To maintain the timeline and project management, Github's Kanban is recommended.

Following tasks will be completed in the phase 1:

1. Selecting the softwares, tools and workspace.
2. Write-ups for each functionality to be included.
3. Business requirements of each functionality.
4. Test plans for each functionality.
5. database structure and requirement analysis.
6. Python Front-end application business requirements and documentation.
7. Overall documentation for maintaining the progress, defects and footnotes during the build.


After completion of Phase 1, a sign-off document is to be released stating the completion, shortcomings and other vital information about phase 1.

Phase 2: Functionality build Part 1.

This phase will mark the beginning of individual units of functionalities. 

The main focus of this phase will be to complete the build of all the necessary and ground level applications that can be tested individually.
Key focus will be on optimisation of the application and hence, the timelines and tasks priorities will be planned accordingly.
// recommended (optional) approach
After building each module, it will pass through unit test in the test development environment and then will be deployed in the test environment 
where system testing will take place.  

// compulsary approach
After building each module, it will pass through unit testing and system testing.

During the testing phase, the defects will be logged and dealt with according to their priority and severity such that the sprint timelines are 
strictly maintained and yet, the build quality is not compromised.   

Phase 3: Funtionality build Part 2.

This Phase will begin after recieving the signoff document from phase 2. 
The document will shed the light on the functionalities that are build successfully,
those that are to be built in the current phase, the defects that were resolved during 
previous phase and the defects that were left open due to unavoidable issues.

This phase will be the longest phase of the projects as it will complete all the functionalities required in the project,
resolve all open defects, successfully complete all the test plans and lay groundwork for integrating all the sub-sections together for next phase.


Phase 4: System Integration and project Sign-off

Once the sign-off is recieved from the phase 3, the system integration will commence.

The main focus of this phase will be to integrate all the functionalities successfully under one module and to provide a front end application
for users to interact with. This will be tested as per the system integration test plan and all the defects and anamolies will be dealt here.

Once the application is ready, it will go through a final black-box testing also to be referred as user acceptance testing. 

It is recommended that the UAT to be performed in a different environment such that the universality of the application is maintained.
